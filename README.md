# Mini-Compiler
The LearnC Compiler, by Josh J. Pantalunan, is a mini-compiler teaching C/C++ basics. It interprets simple code, showing lexical analysis (tokens like int, +), parsing (AST with operator rules), and interpretation (runs with integer variable map). It supports variables, if-else, while loops, cout/printf output, cin input, functions for simplicity.
