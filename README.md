# Mini-Compiler
The LearnC Compiler, by Josh J. Pantalunan, is a mini-compiler teaching C/C++ basics. It interprets simple code, showing lexical analysis (tokens like int, +), parsing (AST with operator rules), and interpretation (runs with integer variable map). It supports variables, if-else, while loops, cout/printf output, cin input, functions for simplicity.

Key features include a lexical analyzer that tokenizes input into keywords (e.g., int, if, while, cout), operators (e.g., +, -, ==), literals (integers and strings with escape sequences), and syntax elements; a recursive descent parser that enforces operator precedence (e.g., * before +) and builds an AST with polymorphic nodes for expressions and statements; an interpreter that executes the AST using a global variable map for integers, supports control flow (if-else, while loops), and handles I/O via cout (with << chaining and endl), printf (%d formatting), and cin (integer input); and a simple CLI user interface for code entry and output display. It supports basic preprocessor directives like #include <iostream> and using namespace std, but deliberately excludes advanced elements such as floating-point numbers, arrays, user-defined functions, pointers, and robust error diagnostics to maintain simplicity.
Compared to full-scale compilers like GCC or Clang, LearnC lacks optimizations, multi-file support, and detailed error reporting, focusing instead on single-file interpretation without generating machine code. Challenges during development included resolving operator precedence conflicts through structured parsing methods, differentiating C-style (printf) and C++-style (cout/cin) I/O syntax via specialized tokenization and parser branches, and implementing basic error recovery (e.g., panic mode for missing semicolons or undefined variables). Recommended improvements encompass language expansions (e.g., floats, arrays, functions with call stacks), debugging tools (e.g., line-number tracking, symbol tables, step-by-step execution), performance tweaks (e.g., constant folding, smart pointers), and UI enhancements (e.g., syntax highlighting, graphical AST visualization, educational tutorials with animated compiler phases).
In summary, LearnC Compiler is a valuable instructional framework that illustrates the interplay of syntax and execution in language processing, making it ideal for classroom demonstrations and self-study. While limited in scope, its design encourages deeper exploration into topics like semantic analysis, memory management, and optimization, as evidenced by sample workflows (e.g., tokenizing and interpreting "cout << 'Hello';") and test cases (e.g., conditional checks and loops with user input). For visual reference, the project's AST structure for a simple while loop might resemble a hierarchical tree with nodes for conditions, binary operations, assignments, and identifiers.
